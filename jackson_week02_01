	//The big point of this assignment is that the variable 'myName' is
+	//supplied by the user and the function 'Main' takes it and uses
	//it to fill in the variable 'name' when it calls 'SayHello'.
	//So first off, you needed to create the function 'Main'
	//and not put the commands under 'Start'.
+	//You had the code working right, but then used 'Hello + myName' which shortcutted
+	//passing myName to name. It should be 'print ("Hello " + name);'
+	//Also, you didn't need to include the variable in 'SayGoodbye'.
